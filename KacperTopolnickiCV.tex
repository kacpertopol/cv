    \emph{description}: My thesis titled: ``The two-nucleon and
    three-nucleon systems in three dimensions'' was successfully
    defended on the 23 of September 2014. Subsequently I was awarded a
    Ph.D. degree in physics on 25 September 2014 after the positive
    decision of the Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Applied Computer
    Science council.

  \item
    \emph{description}: My half year stay at the interdisciplinary
    research center in Jülich gave me the possibility to have direct
    access to specialists in parallel computing on large computing
    clusters. This was a great opportunity and had a big impact on my
    research.

    switched over to the
    \href{https://fais.uj.edu.pl/applied-nuclear-physics-and-innovative-technologies}{International
    PhD Studies in Applied Nuclear Physics and Innovative Technologies}.
    The studies lasted for four years. My chosen topic ``Few-nucleon
    fusion reactions'' was being supervised of professor Jacek Golak.

  \item
    \emph{description}: PhD studies in Nuclear Physics under the
    supervision of professor Jacek Golak. My research was focused on the
    description of few (two, three) nucleon systems. The character of my
    work was theoretical and included the development of effective
    implementations of numerical calculations on large computing
    clusters (JUQUEEN at the Jülich Supercomputing Centre). A large
    portion of my efforts were focused on developing consistent methods
    for treating the complicated algebraic expressions that arise in the
    calculations. The development of these methods was made possible
    with the use of symbolic programming within the
    \href{https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/}{Mathematica} system.

      decision of the Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Applied Computer
      Science council.

      \emph{description}: PhD studies in Nuclear Physics under the
      supervision of professor Jacek Golak. My research was focused on
      the description of few (two, three) nucleon systems. The character
      of my work was theoretical and included the development of
      effective implementations of numerical calculations on large
      computing clusters (JUQUEEN at the Jülich Supercomputing Centre).
      A large portion of my efforts were focused on developing
      consistent methods for treating the complicated algebraic
      expressions that arise in the calculations. The development of
      these methods was made possible with the use of symbolic
      programming within the
      \href{https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/}{Mathematica} system.
